Note to the Reader
=============================
Hello, and welcome to Selenium!  The Documentation Team would like to 
welcome you, and to thank you for being interested in Selenium.

We have worked very, very hard on this document.  Why?  We absolutely believe 
this is the best tool for web-application testing.  We feel its extensibility 
and flexibility, along with its tight integration with the browser, is 
unmatched by available proprietary tools.  We are very excited to promote 
Selenium and, hopefully, to expand its user community.  In short, we really 
want to "get the word out" about Selenium.

We truly believe you will be similarly excited once you learn how Selenium 
approaches test automation.  It's quite different from other tools.  
Whether you are brand-new to Selenium, or have been using it for awhile, 
we believe this documentation will truly help to spread the knowledge around.  
Also, we have aimed to write so that those completely new to test automation 
will be able to use this document as a stepping stone.  No doubt, 
experienced users and "newbies" will benefit from our Selenium User's Guide. 

Please realize that this document is a work in progress.  There are planned areas we
haven't written yet.  However, we have written the beginning chapters first 
so newcomers can get started more smoothly.  We have also already added some valuable 
information that more experienced users will appreciate.  This document will be a 'live'
document on the SeleniumHQ website where frequent updates will occur as we complete
the additional planned documentation.

                    Thanks very much for reading.
