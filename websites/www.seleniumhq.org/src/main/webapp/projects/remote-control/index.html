<p><b>Selenium Remote Control</b> (RC) is a test tool that allows you to write automated web application UI tests in any programming language against any
HTTP website using any mainstream JavaScript-enabled browser. </p>
<p>Selenium RC comes in two parts.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>A server which
    automatically launches and kills browsers, and acts as a
    HTTP proxy for web requests from them.</li>
  <li>Client libraries for your favorite computer language.</li>
</ol>
<p>The RC server also bundles <a href="/projects/core/">Selenium Core</a>, and automatically loads it into the browser.</p>
<p>Here is a simplified architectural representation....</p>

<p>Selenium Remote Control is great for testing complex AJAX-based web user interfaces
  under a Continuous Integration system.  It is also an ideal solution for users of
  Selenium Core or Selenium IDE who want to write tests in a more
  expressive programming language than the Selenese HTML table format customarily
  used with Selenium Core.</p>
