<h2>Platform Compatibility</h2>
<p>This page is built based on users' feedback.  Please <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-ruby">contact us</a> if you have anything to contribute.</p>
<p>there are issues running different browsers, at least for some on osx and linux.  This is testable by
dropping into IRB and running the selenium gem API and issuing some
simple commands.</p>

<h2>Unix/Linux</h2>
<p>The latest Ubuntu Desktop (8.04) should work, and is a good choice if
you are new to unix/linux. There were some renames of the binaries (firefox is now
firefox2) so you might need to make symlinks.  On the other hand, you can always use
the custom browser string too.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Windows</h2>
<p>Windows XP</p>
