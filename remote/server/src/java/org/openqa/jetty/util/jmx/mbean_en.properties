ThreadPool = Pool of reusable threads. Changes made to this MBean are not persisted.
ThreadPool.name = Name of the pool.
ThreadPool.threadClass = Class of the Threads
ThreadPool.threads = Number of thread instances.
ThreadPool.idleThreads = number of idle threads.
ThreadPool.minThreads = minimum number of threads allowed
ThreadPool.maxThreads = maximum number of threass allowed
ThreadPool.maxIdleTimeMs = Time in MS that a thread can be idle before it may expire.
ThreadPool.threadsPriority = priority of the pool threads
ThreadPool.maxStopTimeMs = DEPRECATED
